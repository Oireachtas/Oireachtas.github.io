The ontology is divided into four main areas:

- **Legislative Documents**  
These are the documents published by the Oireachtas as part of a deliberative process in a chamber. The most important example of a legislative document is a Bill, which is a draft law, but legislative documents could also be Standing Orders governing the conduct of business in the Oireachtas; motions that are proposed, moved or agreed by a chamber; documents laid before the Oireachtas; and reports prepared by committees.  

  Legislative Documents do not include documents published by the Service, however.

- **Journal Events**  
These are the procedures through which the business of the Oireachtas is planned and recorded, most importantly in respect of procedures that affect legislative documents during their lifecycle.

- **Debates**

- **Oireachtas Agents**
